# Advent of Code 2025 – Python

This repository contains my solutions to **Advent of Code 2025**, implemented in **Python**.

Each day's challenge is stored in its own directory, with the following structure:

    Day1/
        main.py
    Day2/
        main.py
    Day3/
        main.py
    ...

Each `main.py` contains the solution for that day's puzzle.

## Running a Solution

From the repository root, navigate into the desired day’s folder and run:

    cd Day1
    python3 main.py
